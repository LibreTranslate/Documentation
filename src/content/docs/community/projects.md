* [LTEngine](https://github.com/LibreTranslate/LTEngine): Machine translation powered by LLMs with a LibreTranslate-compatible API
* [LexiLang](https://github.com/LibreTranslate/LexiLang): Simple, fast dictionary-based language detector for short texts
* [Locomotive](https://github.com/LibreTranslate/Locomotive): Toolkit for training/converting LibreTranslate compatible language models
