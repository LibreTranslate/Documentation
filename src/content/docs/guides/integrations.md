Many software packages have been integrated with LibreTranslate. Some of them are listed below:

## Discourse Plugin

You can use the [official discourse translator plugin](https://github.com/discourse/discourse-translator) to translate [Discourse](https://discourse.org) topics with LibreTranslate. To install it simply modify `/var/discourse/containers/app.yml`:

```yaml
## Plugins go here
## see https://meta.discourse.org/t/19157 for details
hooks:
  after_code:
    - exec:
        cd: $home/plugins
        cmd:
          - git clone https://github.com/discourse/docker_manager.git
          - git clone https://github.com/discourse/discourse-translator
    ...
```

Then issue `./launcher rebuild app`. From the Discourse's admin panel then select "LibreTranslate" as a translation provider and set the relevant endpoint configurations.
